# Password-Generator

## Welcome to your new Password Generator!

I have put together a Password Generator that meets your specifications so that you can be secure when storing your sensitive data. Simply follow the prompts connected to the webpage and retrieve the password from the field in the screen!

Below you will find examples of the code that went into making your password generator. It is designed to keep inputs within the parameters I set and will nudge you in the right direction if you fail to give it the input that it needs.

### This is the code that asks you to input the password length

### This is the code that generates lower case letters if you choose to include them

### This is the code that makes sure you give the generator a character set
